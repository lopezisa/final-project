            <!-- RESOURCED FROM W3 SCHOOLS (ABOVE) -->
          <p>WarmZItUp was created by three brothers–Bob, Allen, and David, who grew up hunting in rural Michigan. Together, they realized a gap in the market while hunting where accessible heating solutions for hunting blinds were lacking. With their combined experience of hunting and desire to improve comfort during the cold weather hunts, they came together to create a unique product designed to keep food and drinks warm using a common tool found in many hunting blinds–a buddy heater. The WarmZItUp Buddy Tray ensures that hunters can stay comfortable and focused on their hunt without worrying about eating cold food or drinking ice-cold drinks during the winter months. </p>
          <p>We hope that the WarmZItUp Buddy Tray will become an easy, accessible tool for all hunters to use. Our company strives to provide high-quality, innovative products to enhance the hunting experience. With the Buddy Tray, hunters can focus on what matters most—enjoying the hunt—without being distracted by the cold.</p>
